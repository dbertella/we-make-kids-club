Helping children build confidence, creativity, and environmental awareness through hands-on making.

### WHAT WE DO

We Make Kids Club offers creative eco-fashion workshops for primary-aged children.

Through repairing, transforming, and redesigning clothes, children learn practical skills while developing confidence, focus, and pride in what they create — all while learning to care for the planet.

### WHY IT MATTERS

At We Make Kids Club, children:

* Build creative confidence and self-expression
* Learn practical sewing and making skills
* Develop focus, patience, and problem-solving
* Understand sustainability through hands-on experience

Sessions are calm, supportive, and pressure-free — creativity over perfection, sustainability over fast fashion.
