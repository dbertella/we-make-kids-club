### About We Make Kids Club

We Make Kids Club was created as a response to fast fashion, overconsumption, and the growing disconnect between people and the things they own.

Through eco-fashion workshops and clubs, We Make Kids Club encourages children, young people, and adults to slow down, make by hand, and reimagine clothing as something to care for rather than discard. Sessions focus on reusing and transforming existing garments and textiles, using simple techniques that prioritise creativity, confidence, and sustainability over perfection.

Workshops are designed to be calm, inclusive, and hands-on. Whether participants are learning to repair, decorate, or transform clothes, the emphasis is always on experimentation, self-expression, and building a more thoughtful relationship with fashion.

### About the organiser

We Make Kids Club is run by Aurélie, a fashion designer and creative facilitator with a background in sustainable fashion and hands-on making.

After studying fashion design, Aurélie spent over ten years working in digital marketing before returning to her creative roots. Alongside launching her own clothing brand, [Painted By Aurélie](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/PaintedByAurelie), she developed We Make Kids Club as a way to combine fashion, creativity, and sustainability in a meaningful, accessible way.

Aurélie now runs eco-fashion clubs and workshops in partnership with schools, youth organisations, and community spaces, creating supportive environments where people of all ages can explore creativity while making more responsible choices.
