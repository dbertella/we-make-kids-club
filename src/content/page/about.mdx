With a background in fashion design, Aurélie has experimented with several creative projects through the years, including clothes making, jewellery making, painting, writing and illustrating.

After 10 years working in digital marketing, Aurélie decided to reconnect with her artistic roots. She recently launched her clothing brand [Painted By Aurélie](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/PaintedByAurelie), with a strong idea to combine fashion, creativity and sustainability. 

In 2025, she decided to start her own kids club, combining her love for sustainable fashion and hands-on crafting, encouraging children to explore creativity while making a positive impact on the planet.
