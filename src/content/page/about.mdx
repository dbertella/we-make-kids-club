### About the kids club

Young people just love fashion and trends (so do we!) but don't you want them to know how to turn old clothes into new ones instead of always asking you to buy something new?

Our hands-on workshops teach young designers, between 5 and 11 years old, the magic of upcycling, sustainable fashion, and creative crafting:

üé® Learning cool skills like sewing, printing, and embellishing

‚ôªÔ∏è Turning old clothes into something new

üå± Expressing creativity while caring for the Earth

### About the organiser

With a background in fashion design, Aur√©lie has experimented with several creative projects through the years, including clothes making, jewellery making, painting, writing and illustrating.

After 10 years working in digital marketing, Aur√©lie decided to reconnect with her artistic roots. She recently launched her clothing brand [Painted By Aur√©lie](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/PaintedByAurelie), with a strong idea to combine fashion, creativity and sustainability.¬†

In 2025, she decided to start her own kids club, combining her love for sustainable fashion and hands-on crafting, encouraging children to explore creativity while making a positive impact on the planet.
