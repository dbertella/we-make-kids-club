### About the kids club

In a world filled with consumerism, why not teaching our kids about reusing, repurposing, upcycling clothes/fabric they already have at home, while doing something fun & creative?

At We Make Kids Club, we want young creatives, between 5 and 11 years old to:

üé® Learn cool skills like sewing, printing, and embellishing

‚ôªÔ∏è Turn old clothes into something new

üå± Express creativity while caring for the Earth

(We're preparing something for preschoolers & their adult too, so if you want to stay updated üëâ [join the community!](https://wemakekidsclub.com/joinus))

> What's in it for children?

* Grow their individuality
* Build confidence
* Build responsible awareness

### About the organiser

With a background in fashion design, Aur√©lie has experimented with several creative projects through the years, including clothes making, jewellery making, painting, writing and illustrating.

After 10 years working in digital marketing, Aur√©lie decided to reconnect with her artistic roots. She recently launched her clothing brand [Painted By Aur√©lie](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/PaintedByAurelie), with a strong idea to combine fashion, creativity and sustainability.¬†

In 2025, she decided to start her own kids club, combining her love for sustainable fashion and hands-on crafting, encouraging children to explore creativity while making a positive impact on the planet!
