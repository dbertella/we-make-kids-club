### About the kids club

Children just love fashion and trends (it's a fact!) but don't you want them to know how to turn old clothes into new ones instead of always asking you to buy something new?

At We Make Kids Club, we want young creatives, between 5 and 11 years old to:

🎨 Learn cool skills like sewing, printing, and embellishing

♻️ Turn old clothes into something new

🌱 Express creativity while caring for the Earth

(We're preparing something for toddlers & their adult too, so if you want to stay updated 👉 [join the community!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zXuFdflCGaa1Cy5DssUORE_lylWr1A_G11lBxmnirxk/edit))

### About the organiser

With a background in fashion design, Aurélie has experimented with several creative projects through the years, including clothes making, jewellery making, painting, writing and illustrating.

After 10 years working in digital marketing, Aurélie decided to reconnect with her artistic roots. She recently launched her clothing brand [Painted By Aurélie](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/PaintedByAurelie), with a strong idea to combine fashion, creativity and sustainability. 

In 2025, she decided to start her own kids club, combining her love for sustainable fashion and hands-on crafting, encouraging children to explore creativity while making a positive impact on the planet!
