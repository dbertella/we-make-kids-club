These relaxed evening workshops are an invitation to slow down, make by hand, and reconnect with the clothes you already own.

Bring a garment you’d like to repair, transform, or personalise. Aurelie will provide the tools, materials, and guidance — from patching and visible mending to fabric painting and simple sewing. Sessions are open-ended and supportive, allowing you to explore at your own pace, whether you’re a complete beginner or have some experience.

Workshops are designed to be small, friendly, and pressure-free. They’re not project-led classes, but shared creative spaces where you decide what to make, learn through doing, and leave with something uniquely yours.
