**We Make Kids Club runs** the **Eco-Fashion Lab**, an [eco-fashion after-school club](https://wemakekidsclub.com/news/The-Eco-Fashion-Lab--After-School-Club) in partnership with primary schools. Clubs take place on school premises and are organised directly through the school.

**What children do**

* Learn basic sewing and textile skills
* Transform old clothes into something new, from small projects to term-long projects
* Explore sustainability in a hands-on, age-appropriate way

**What children gain**

* Confidence and pride in making
* Focus and problem-solving skills
* A positive relationship with clothes and waste

**How to join**

Eco-Fashion Club is available through participating schools only (currently George Tomlinson and Davies Lane in Leytonstone).

If you’re interested in bringing eco-fashion to your school (presentation, workshops):
