**We Make Kids Club runs** the **Eco-Fashion Lab**, an [eco-fashion after-school club](https://wemakekidsclub.com/news/The-Eco-Fashion-Lab--After-School-Club) in partnership with primary schools.

The Eco-Fashion Lab is available through participating schools only (currently George Tomlinson and Davies Lane in Leytonstone).

**What children do**

* Learn basic sewing and textile skills
* Transform old clothes into something new, from small projects to term-long projects
* Explore sustainability in a hands-on, age-appropriate way

**What children gain**

* Confidence and pride in making
* Focus and problem-solving skills
* A positive relationship with clothes and waste

**Want to bring eco-fashion to your school?**


If you’d like to see eco-fashion workshops at your child’s school, you can share **We Make Kids Club** with the school or PTA. I’m happy to work directly with schools to offer *eco-fashion presentations* and *curriculum-linked workshops* during school hours.
