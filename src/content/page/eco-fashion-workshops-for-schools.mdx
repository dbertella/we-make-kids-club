**We Make Kids Club** delivers hands-on eco-fashion workshops for primary schools (open to youth organisations and communities), helping children explore sustainability through creative making.

**Why eco-fashion in schools?**

Fashion has a significant environmental impact, and children are increasingly aware of trends and consumption from a young age. Eco-fashion workshops offer a positive, hands-on way to help children:

* Understand sustainability in a meaningful, age-appropriate way
* Develop creative and practical skills
* Build confidence, focus, and problem-solving abilities
* Take pride in caring for and reusing what they already have

These sessions complement classroom learning while offering something different: time to slow down, make with their hands, and think critically.

**How we work with schools**

* Workshops are delivered on site at schools or community venues
* Sessions are designed for small groups to maximise engagement
* Activities are adapted to suit different ages and abilities
* Workshops can be one-off sessions or part of a longer programme

For larger groups, classes can be split to ensure children receive appropriate support and guidance.
