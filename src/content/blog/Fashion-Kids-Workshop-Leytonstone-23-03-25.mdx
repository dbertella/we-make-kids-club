# It's happening!

I'm organising an event for kids age 5-11 and their grown-up (and yes, grown-ups get to make something too), and I’d love to see you there.

Join me for this Eco-Fashion Kids Workshop - Special Mother's Day, on Sunday, March 23, 2025.

Tell your friends and **book now** because places are limited.

## FAQ

**What is it?** An eco-fashion kids workshop, where you will learn how to turn an old t-shirt (can be stained, with holes, anything) into a cool boho necklace.

**When?** Sunday, March 23 from 2pm to 3pm.

**Who can come?** Children age 5-11 and their adult.

**Where?** Stone Mini Market in Leytonstone (where else?)

**How do I sign up?** Please book on EventBrite to secure your place, there's a small £5 fee for this discovery tester session.

**Do I need to bring anything?** Please bring an old t-shirt if you can (one that you're never going to wear again), as you get to make something unique out of it. A few more will be available but please bring at least one if you can.
