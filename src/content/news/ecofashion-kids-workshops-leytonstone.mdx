We‚Äôre thrilled to announce that **We Make Kids Club** is now officially in residence at **Good Shepherd Studios** in Leytonstone for the next 3 months! Starting this May, our **eco-fashion workshops** will take place **every Saturday morning** (term time) from 10:30 to 12:00, bringing creativity, sustainability, and hands-on fun to local families.

These sessions are all about empowering children **aged 5-11+** to **make their own clothes** and accessories using second-hand materials, forgotten wardrobe treasures, and their brilliant imaginations. Think old t-shirts turned into trendy new tops or bags, jeans jazzed up with patches or beads, and one-of-a-kind fashion accessories made from scrap fabric!

*Note: children under 7 will require an adult to stay throughout the session. Siblings (of children with a paid ticket) aged 3-4 year old are welcome to stay for free and try some activities.*

üëï **Make it. Wear it. Love it.**
We believe fashion can be both fun and sustainable. Through each workshop, children learn practical skills like:

* **Hand sewing**
* **Fabric printing & painting**
* **Creative embellishing** with patches, ties, beads and more

Our approach is accessible, child-led, and packed with creative freedom. The workshops are designed for children **aged 5+**, but little eco-makers **under 7 are welcome with adult supervision throughout the session**.

Whether your child is a budding designer or just loves to create, these workshops are a great way to learn **useful skills**, **build confidence**, and **connect with the world of sustainable fashion**.

**üìç When & Where**

* Every **Saturday** | **10:30 AM ‚Äì 12:00 PM**
* **Good Shepherd Studios**, Leytonstone, E11

Come turn your old clothes into something beautiful‚Äîand help your child discover that style and sustainability can go hand in hand. Spaces are limited, so book early to secure a spot!
