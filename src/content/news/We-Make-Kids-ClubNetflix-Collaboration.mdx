### Why Netflix & Eco-Fashion?

When Netflix reached out to me, I was both honoured and excited — what a unique opportunity to bring sustainable creativity into the glossy, modern halls of a global media company. I knew this day would not just be about sewing and fabric scraps — but about combining creativity, fun, and conscious making.

### What We Did — The Day in Pictures

From the moment I arrived at Netflix’s Corporate offices in Oxford Circus, the energy was buzzing as they had a family fun day going on for all employees and their family (over 300 people came!). I set up a huge creative station designed to let kids (age 4–14) explore upcycling and eco-fashion in a playful, hands-on way.

For the occasion, an important part of my time was spent sourcing second-hand materials and fabrics that would match the Netflix themes: Wednesday and K-Pop Demon Hunters. I created special moodboards to inspire further the children.

During the workshops, children upcycled plain cotton t-shirts using paint and markers, cutting fabrics, adding ribbons and beads to create their own masterpiece. I was truly impressed by their creativity!

Then came the selfie moment — me in front of the big red Netflix logo — a symbol of how far creativity can travel when we mix fun, community and sustainability.

### What It Meant — For Me, For the Kids, and For Eco-Fashion

This collaboration was more than just a “one-off workshop.”

* For the kids: It was a chance to experiment, get their hands messy, and create something they were proud of with their own two hands.
* For eco-fashion: It showed that upcycling and conscious creativity aren’t just niche — they fit beautifully in new, unexpected spaces (like a corporate studio), and appeal to all ages.
* For me: It confirmed why I do this — I love seeing children discover confidence, creativity, and care for the planet  — and that message resonates beyond traditional classrooms or craft clubs.

### Lessons Learned & What I’ll Do Next

Collaborating with a big name like Netflix taught me three big things:

1. Simplicity wins. Kids loved simple tools — fabric scraps + yarn + a bit of guidance — over anything fancy.
2. Community matters. Having kids of different ages and backgrounds working together added energy, inspiration, and sharing.
3. Visibility helps spread the message. A fun day, photos, and a story — it becomes more than a workshop. It becomes an invitation.

Because of how well this went, I’m now more motivated than ever to expand my workshops — at clubs, schools, and even to adult groups.

### What’s Next — Join the Creative Movement

If you’re inspired by this collaboration and want to bring eco-fashion — whether for kids or adults — into your community, school, family, or workplace: get in touch. I’d love to help you design a session, supply recycled materials, or guide you through upcycling projects.
