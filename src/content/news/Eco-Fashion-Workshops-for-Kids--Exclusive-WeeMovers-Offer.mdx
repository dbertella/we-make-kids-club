## Discover We Make Kids Club — and Get a Special Offer!

Hello,

Your child joined us for an Eco-Fashion workshop at WeeMovers Holiday Camp, and I hope they had as much fun creating as I did!

I started We Make Kids Club because I believe creativity and sustainability can go hand in hand. That’s why I run hands-on workshops where children upcycle, design and make their own fashion and accessories — learning real skills while caring for the planet.

What We Offer:

* Saturday Eco-Fashion Workshops (recommended age: 5–11)
* Themed activities every month: upcycling, hand sewing, fabric painting, personalisation & more
* All materials provided — plus kids can bring old clothes to give them a second life
* A fun, inclusive and gender-friendly space to build confidence and express their style

📍 Where: Leytonstone
🕙 When: Saturdays (once a month, check dates on Eventbrite)
💰 Price: £15 per child per session

***
