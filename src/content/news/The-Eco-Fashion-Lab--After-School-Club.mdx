### Introducing: The Eco-Fashion Lab

**An After School Club combining Fashion & Sustainability!**

We’re thrilled to announce that starting this September, **The Eco-Fashion Lab**  will be launching as a brand-new **after-school club** at **George Tomlinson** and **Davies Lane** **Primary Schools** in **Leytonstone**!

This unique and exciting club blends creativity, sustainability, and self-expression through fashion — and it’s open to all children in **Years 3/4 to 6**.

#### What is The Eco-Fashion Lab?

It’s a fun, hands-on club where children will learn how to reimagine fashion in eco-friendly ways. Through weekly one-hour sessions, kids will explore everything from basic hand sewing to upcycling old clothes using patches, fabric paint, glue, and a whole lot of imagination!

**Children Will Learn:**

🧵 Basic hand sewing

♻️ How to upcycle/transform old clothes into something new

👕 Cutting, styling, and decorating old clothes using fabric paint/patches/glue

🎨 Expressing their own personal style

🌍 Easy, age-appropriate lessons on sustainable fashion choices

✨ All building up to an end-of-term mini fashion show to celebrate their creations!

**Why This Club is Great for Your Child:**

✅ Builds **confidence** through creative expression

✅ Grows their **individuality** and sense of style

✅ Encourages **responsibility** through sustainable habits

✅ And it’s completely **gender-friendly** and **inclusive**

All materials are provided (with many donated or repurposed to support our eco-friendly mission), so children will just need to bring some old clothes to transform!

**🌟 Parents, Here’s Why You’ll Love It Too**

Not only is The Eco-Fashion Lab a great way to keep your child engaged and learning after school, but it also helps them build life skills, care for the planet, and feel proud of their unique creativity. It’s the kind of club every school should have — and **we’d love to bring it to more schools in the area**, too!

If you're a parent or teacher and would love to see The Eco-Fashion Lab at your school, we’d love to hear from you — let’s bring more eco-creativity to East London and beyond!
