Many of us have old T-shirts in our wardrobe, that haven't been worn in ages and probably will never see the light again except to be getting rid off. Those T-shirts might have stains, holes, maybe they're too big, too small or just too old to even be donated.

Material needed:

* An old T-shirt
* A good pair of scissors (fabric scissors, ideally)

**Here is step by step tutorial on how to make T-shirt yarn using the whole t-shirt:**

1. Lay your T-shirt flat on the floor/table and cut bottom and sleeves hems.
2. Next, cut your T-shirt in 4 parts: cut the sleeves without the seam (the seam needs to stay on the upper body)
3. Starting with the main body part, fold it side to side leaving about 2cm non overlapping section.
4. Cut strips (about 2-3cm) across the T-shirt stopping 2cm from the edge.
5. To turn it into one long strand, lay it flat and cut diagonally across the “spine.” Start from the edge of the first strip and cut to the edge of the next—like a zigzag. This joins the loops into a continuous spiral. That's your first piece of yarn!
6. Lay the sleeve flat, seam at the top and fold lining up the internal edge (the one that was attached to the body)
7. Cut the sleeve into strips stopping before the seam. Leave the last one for now.
8. Open the sleeve along the the seam. Starting from the internal edge, cut the first strip loose then keep cutting diagonally. Don't cut the last strip yet.
9. At this point, depending on the size of your sleeve, you might be able to cut another zigzag in your strip or you can just keep a slightly larger one. Pull it and make it into yarn ball. Repeat steps 6-9 for the other sleeve.
10. Finally, fold the upper body part in half, cut your 2cm strips across, stopping at the seams.
11. Lay open the T-shirt and starting from the back side, cut alternating ends of the strips (as per picture) to make one long piece. Continue up to the neck seam.
12. Now starting from the front side, cut alternating sides cutting into the shoulder area too. Discard seams from neck and shoulders.

Now that you have 4 pieces of yarn, you might as well want to join them to make one big yarn ball?

How to connect the ends of your T-shirt yarn?

* To do so, you could just knot the ends together, but I prefer the following method:
* Take the two ends you want to connect. Make a tiny cut (about 2cm from the end or it might break) on both ends.
* Insert yarn A through the opening in yarn B. 
* Take the other end of yarn A, pass it through the opening of same yarn and pull the entire length delicately all the way through. Done!
*

Now you have big yarn ball made out of a whole T-shirt! The only parts you won't be using are the hems and a tiny scrap. But instead of throwing them away, you can keep them in a bag or box to make future stuffing!

I hope this tutorial is useful. The first time I tried it myself I found it a bit tricky, so trust the process and it will get easier, I promise!
