We‚Äôre thrilled to announce that **We Make Kids Club** is now officially in residence at **Good Shepherd Studios** in Leytonstone **for** **the** **next 3 months!** Starting this May, our **eco-fashion workshops** will take place **every Saturday morning**, bringing creativity, sustainability, and hands-on fun to local families.

These sessions are all about empowering children **aged 7 and up** to **make their own clothes** and accessories using second-hand materials, forgotten wardrobe treasures, and their brilliant imaginations. Think old t-shirts turned into trendy new tops, jeans jazzed up with patches and beads, and one-of-a-kind tote bags made from scrap fabric!

üëï **Reuse. Repair. Rewear.**
We believe fashion can be both fun and sustainable. Through each workshop, children learn practical skills like:

* **Hand sewing** (with sewing machines introduced over time)
* **Fabric printing & painting**
* **Creative embellishing** with patches, ties, beads and more

Our approach is accessible, child-led, and packed with creative freedom. The workshops are designed for children **aged 7+**, but little eco-makers **under 7 are welcome with adult supervision throughout the session**.

Whether your child is a budding designer or just loves to create, these workshops are a great way to learn **useful skills**, **build confidence**, and **connect with the world of sustainable fashion**.

**üìç When & Where**

Every **Saturday** | **10:30 AM ‚Äì 12:00 PM**

**Good Shepherd Studios**, Leytonstone, E11

Come turn your old clothes into something beautiful‚Äîand help your child discover that style and sustainability can go hand in hand. Spaces are limited, so book early to secure a spot!

**üßµ How will the sessions be structured?**

Each workshop will have a theme, so all children get to learn/master a skill and take home their creation(s).

*Note: It's important that everyone brings a piece of clothing (whatsoever) to the session, as the whole idea is to teach children to reuse/upcycle.*

> May 03: Turn a T-shirt into a Bag

* **What to bring:** An old T-shirt (can be an adult-sized T-shirt)
* **Main activity**: Children will discover how to transform an old T-shirt into a reusable bag.
* **Creative challenge:** We‚Äôll explore different ways to embellish their new accessory.

> May 10: Learn Some Cool Stitches

* **What to bring:** Nothing special ‚Äî denim donations appreciated
* **Main activity**: Using hessian fabric, plastic needles, and embroidery thread, we‚Äôll practice some of the most useful beginner stitches: running stitch, backstitch, and blanket stitch.
* **Creative challenge:** Children will create their own miniature pillow or tiny purse.

> May 17: Print & Pattern Design with Recycled Objects

* **What to bring:** A piece of clothing of their choice to paint on
* **Main activity:** Children will experiment with pattern design on paper using bottle caps, mesh, toilet rolls, cardboard, and more. They‚Äôll also get to make their own stamps.
* **Creative challenge:** They‚Äôll print their favourite pattern onto a square of fabric or directly onto their chosen garment.

> May 24: Stencil & Paint Your Top

* **What to bring:** A top of their choice, preferably light-coloured
* **Main activity:** Children will explore techniques to elevate their painting skills using stencils on fabric.
* **Creative challenge**: We‚Äôll also look at ways to frame and finish their work using fabric markers, stitches, beads, ribbons, or extra fabric for mixed-media designs.
