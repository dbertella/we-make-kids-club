Join us for this Eco-Fashion Kids Workshop - Special Mother's Day, on **Sunday, March 23, 2025**.

<ButtonComponent url="/example.com">Book now</ButtonComponent>

During this session, kids and their grown-up will work together to **turn an old t-shirt into a unique and stylish necklace**. I will show you different techniques that can be used and provide material to make your creation extra special.

I've been doing a lot of research, gathering ideas and material and testing (yes, with real-life kids).

We had loads of fun during this tester session - including two girls and a boy who is not a big fan of craft. I think they enjoyed the transformation, sharing colours, the option of making something very simple or adding more style to it and ultimately having something to wear at the end.

So why do you have to bring an old t-shirt?

Firstly, because it will be more fun for you if it's yours. Secondly, because you get to mix colours with others if you want to. And finally, because any fabric scrap left at the end of the workshop will be used for another one. You heard me: not a single piece of fabric will go to the bin. I also bring extra material to make your fashion accessory even more special. And because it's a soft launch, I'm only asking for a small contribution to help covering material and location costs.

At the end of the session, you get to take your creation(s) home, gift it for Mother's Day, give it to a friend or keep it to yourself - it's up to you!

Tell your friends and **[book now](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/eco-fashion-kids-workshop-special-mothers-day-tickets-1253822740569?aff=oddtdtcreator)** because places are limited.

I hope to see you there!
