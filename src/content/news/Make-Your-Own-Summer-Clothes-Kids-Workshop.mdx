Does your kid like to make things? You have some old clothes taking space in your house? Could they be interested in learning how to transform and customise their clothes?

Come and join us for an hour of eco-fashion on April 23 for an After School session at Bread & Oregano (Leyton).

The theme will be “Make your own Summer clothes!” so Children will need to bring clothes they want to customise (old t-shirts (kid or adult size) to cut and customise, old trousers to cut and patch up). 

We’ll explore different ways we can upcycle our old clothes to create cool tops and shorts just in time for those warmer days: through cutting techniques, fringes, patching up, adding decorations and much more! 

Possibilities are endless! 

Where? Bread & Oregano in Leyton

When? Wednesday, April 23, 2025 at 4pm (until 5pm)

What to bring? Some old clothes to customise (t-shirts, shorts or trousers)

What material will be available? different fabrics and accessories like ribbons, lots of beads, fabric markers, scissors, fabric glue, etc.

Share the news with your friends and see you on the 23rd!
