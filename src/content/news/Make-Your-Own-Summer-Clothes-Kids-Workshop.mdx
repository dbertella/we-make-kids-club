Does your kid like to *make* things? You have some old clothes taking space in your house? Could they be interested in learning how to transform and customise their clothes?

Come and join us for an **after school workshop on April 23 at Bread & Oregano (Leyton).**

#### “Make your own Summer clothes!”

Children will need to bring clothes they want to customise:

* T-shirts: too small, too big, stained, with holes, old or new
* Bottoms: trousers that are too small, stained, with holes or shorts they want to personalise

#### What will the session look like?

We’ll explore different ways we can upcycle our old clothes to create cool tops and shorts just in time for those warmer days: through cutting techniques, fringes, patching up, adding decorations and much more! 

You bring old clothes and I bring the supplies for them to experiment and upcycle: *possibilities are endless!*

**Who?** Boys and girls, age 7+ (children under 7 can join if guided by their adult during the session)

**Where?** Bread & Oregano in Leyton

**When?** Wednesday, April 23, 2025 at 4pm (until 5pm)

**What to bring?** Some old clothes to customise (t-shirts, shorts or trousers)

**What supplies will be available?** Different fabrics and accessories like ribbons, beads, fabric markers, scissors, fabric glue, etc.

**How much is the session?** The session costs £12 per child - but look out for a discount voucher in the newsletter! If you miss it after registering, you can always send me a DM on Instagram and I'll send it to you.

S*ee you on the 23rd! x*
