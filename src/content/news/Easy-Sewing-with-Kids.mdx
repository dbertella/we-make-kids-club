### Can you sew with young children?

As a parent, you might wonder if your child is ready to learn sewing. The age range for starting sewing varies widely, with some suggesting as young as 2 years old and others recommending 8 years old. However, the truth is that every child is different, and readiness really depends on their individual interest and ability.

#### Understanding Your Child's Readiness

When I had this question, I realised that the answer lies in understanding your child's unique readiness, and you are the best person to know that, no one else. My first child, now 9, didn't show much interest in sewing when he was younger â€” it could be because I never tried with him before so, I'm a bit biased. However, my 3-year-old has been eager to try everything I do, including using a needle and thread, from the age of 2.

#### Starting Early with Simple Projects

At around 2 years old, I introduced my younger child to basic sewing concepts using cardboard with holes and yarn. It's just one of these simple activities that help develop their fine motor skills and spark their curiosity. Later, I discovered that using colourful pipe cleaners can make the process even easier.

#### Moving to Real Hand Sewing

Recently, I decided it was time to introduce my child to actual sewing using plastic needles. I used some old hessian fabric, which is perfect for beginners due to its open weave and biodegradable nature. This fabric is sturdy yet easy for small hands to handle. If you don't have any though, you can still make like a stitch card, poking holes in a piece of cardboard.

#### Encouraging Independence

As adults, we often forget that children learn best through experimentation and making mistakes (guilty!). My child insisted on cutting the fabric himself, and I let him choose the thread colour. After threading the needle, I tied a knot so we only had to thread it once. I guided him through the basic sewing motion, but I also let him decide where to place the needle next.

#### Making It Fun

Sewing with young children should be fun! My child enjoyed pulling the thread and watching what was happening to the fabric. I explained that he was creating a drawing, and after a few minutes, I added some eyes and a mouth to show him he had made a little monster. And that was it!

#### Conclusion

The right age for sewing with children isn't about a specific number; it's about recognising their readiness and willingness to learn. Ultimately it's about when YOU are ready. Just remember to start with simple projects and to have fun together.
