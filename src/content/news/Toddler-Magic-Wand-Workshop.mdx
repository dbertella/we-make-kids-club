Looking for a weekday activity that’s fun, meaningful, and perfect for little hands?

Join us on Tuesday 8th July in Leytonstone for a magical, hands-on workshop designed especially for children aged 2–4 and their grown-ups. In this one-hour session, your child will get to make their very own eco-friendly magic wand – and take it home to continue the magic!

* Magic wand making using sustainable, planet-friendly materials

### Why Sustainable Crafting?

We believe even the littlest learners can start exploring what it means to care for our planet. That’s why all materials used in this workshop are thoughtfully sourced and designed to minimise waste. Your child will walk away with a keepsake craft that’s as meaningful as it is magical.
